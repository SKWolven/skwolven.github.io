  </div>

<!--THE CHALLENGE-->
    <h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
    <p>When my company changed our payroll and benefits administration management over to ADP Total Source I was excited. Their sales team did a great job of showing the value of partnering with ADP - <span class="pull" start="" end="" title="ADP does not know how to internet"></span>the company would be saving a significant amount on fees and benefits, and employees would have more coverage with lower cost benefits, more choices of ancillary benefits, and discounts on a variety of goods and services.</p>
    <p>So why with all of those benefits and perks were my colleagues saying things like, "I've always hated ADP?"</p>
    <p>The desktop portal is so difficult and unpleasant to navigate that my colleagues and I were not able to enjoy all of the great things ADP has to offer. When a colleague remarked "ADP does not know how to internet," I decided to try my hand at redesigning their online experience.</p><br>

<!--THE RESEARCH-->
    <h2>THE RESEARCH</h2>
     <p>By interviewing a number of users and observing them as they attempted to navigate the platform I identified several major pain points:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The language feels robotic and is often difficult to understand.</li>
      <li>The menus have too many options making them difficult to navigate.</li>
      <li>Important information and tasks are buried in menus and take several steps to access.</li>
      <li>Superfluous and inapplicable information is presented up front.</li>
      <li>The timecards are troublesome to use. Everyone hated the process of recording their hours.</li>
    </ul>
   <p>I compared the platform to other PEOs (Professional Employer Organization) that I've had experience with - Zenefits, Insperity, and especially Justworks, because I had full access to an admin account there. These competitors were able to meet all of the same legal standards without sacrificing their UX/UI so I knew it was possible.</p><br>

<!--THE STRUCTURE-->
      <h2>THE STRUCTURE</h2>
      <p>All of the pain points essentially boiled down to having too much on the site. ADP records an enormous amount of information for every employee and has a complex coding system for managing their data. Hardly any of that data or those codes are useful to individual employees, so <span class="pull2" title="my first task was to figure out what could go and what needed to stay"></span> my first task was to figure out what could go and what needed to stay.</p>
      <p>I made a list of the features and information available on the platform. I compared my list with what was available through Justworks and then  organized the list items based on level of importance to the user. Tier 1 items - pay information, time keeping, and benefits - would have to be among the first things a user sees upon accessing the site. Tier 2 items like personal information, compliance training, and support would also need to be easily accessible, but could be lower down on the page than tier 1 items. Tier 3 items like company policies and account settings could be accessed via menus. Everything else could be removed from the front end.</p><br>

<!--THE VOICE-->
      <h2>THE VOICE</h2>
      <p>I developed guidelines for how the product should communicate with the user. I wanted to simplify the language and refine the tone without completely changing the brand voice.</p>
      <p>The tone should be clear, concise, conversational, inclusive, friendly, and user-focused. Wherever inclusivity is not feasable due to legal requirements, alternatives must be provided (eg. legal name AND preferred name). It should NOT be aggressive, accusatory, informal, or joking.</p><br>

          <p class="caption">rewritten error message</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>There's almost nothing worse than encountering an error message that doesn't explain anything or give any advice for what to do next. This error message was displayed when I tried to update my tax withholdings before ADP had set up that feature for my account. It would have been better if the error message advised to try again later and even better if it also provided contact information for assistance.</p><br>

        <p class="caption">rewritten error message</p><br>
      <p>A colleague encountered this error during the benefits enrollment process. He had followed directions correctly and was still getting this message. Not only was he frustrated that the error kept popping up, but the copy was bordering on insulting. The 'Oops!' at the beginning is meant to be lighthearted, but it is tonally inconsistent with the rest of the product and implies that the user has done something wrong. A better error message does not blame the user, but does provide solutions.</p><br>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p id="aligned">When I first saw this message I had no idea what it meant and had to ask our account rep to explain it to me. It turns out this message is intended for companies who use a timeclock with a fingerprint scanner to let the administrator know when the employee's fingerprints will be cleared from the system. Since my company wasn't using a fingerprint scanner I was confused by this message that comes up every time a termination is processed. I would urge ADP to remove any alerts that do not apply based on a client's account settings. Rather than try to rewrite a message like this, I would remove it.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-4">
        <p>I assumed this meant that employees would be required to clock in onsite. What this actually means is that employees who are elligible for overtime pay must record their time to clock in/out, and that they could do it from any location with internet access. I would rephrase this as "Online clock enabled for non-exempt employees."</p>

<!--THE SURFACE-->
      <h2>THE SURFACE</h2>
        <p>I decided to keep a similar color scheme and overal presentation in order to maintain consistency with other ADP products. Their brand has a very corporate feel and I wanted to preserve that.</p>
        <div class="row">

           <img class="myImg2" src="images/studies/adphomeREAL.png" alt="the home screen of ADP Total Source">

            <p class="caption">my redesigned ADP portal home page</p>
          </div>
        </div>
    <p> I've eliminated the empty space and reorganized the structure so that important tasks and information are up front. Anything a user is most likely to be looking for is on the homepage and above the fold. I also removed items that a user would probably not be interested in, like the links for Compliance Updates and Invoices which are only relevant to administrators.</p><br>
    <img class="myImg2" src="images/studies/adpmenus.jpg" alt="screencap of expanded adp menu and redesigned menu expanded on top">
        <p class="caption">ADP's expanded menu and my redesigned version</p>
          <p>By reorganizing the structure of the site I was able to simplify navigation and eliminate the secondary nav bar. I brought the menu elements down from 35 to 13.</p><br>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <img class="myImg2" src="images/studies/adptimesheetREAL.png" alt="screen shot of the ADP Total Source time sheet">

      <p class="caption">redesigned page for time and time off</p>
    </div>
  </div>
    <p>The actual ADP timesheet includes codes that provide no value to the user. That information could be recorded without being displayed. In my version I removed the department, job title, position ID, and pay codes. I also provided two ways to clock in and out - either on the home page, or from the time and attendance page. ADP has separate buttons to clock in, clock out, and in some cases they have separate buttons for clocking in and out for lunch too. I brought it down to one button that will record time and automatically set the in/out status depending on the user's last recorded time.</p><br>

<!--THE OUTCOME-->
  <h2>THE OUTCOME</h2>
   <span class="pull" title="ADP would improve customer satisfaction and client retention"></span><p>One ADP customer I spoke with told me, "My company is desperate to get off of ADP." By designing a product that users love - or at the absolute minimum, that they don't hate - ADP would improve customer satisfaction and client retention.</p>
  <p>I eliminated unnecessary white space and removed a lot of clutter. The portal as I designed it is simple to navigate, the process to record time is uncomplicated, and alpha numeric codes have been either replaced with plain language or removed entirely.
  An actual slogan ADP uses is "Always Designing for People." If they implemented my changes they could begin to say that truthfully.</p>
