  <h2>What I can do</h2>
  <p class="intro">I have experience with retail, e-commerce, customer service, human resources, operations, and administrative 
  support across a variety of industries. Iâ€™m never happy with just one project on my plate, and I love to learn new 
  things. With a keen editorial eye I am passionate about helping creators realize the best version of their own 
  projects. See below for my work history and writing samples.</p>

        <p>Frederator Networks is a digital media company based in New York City. The major divisions of Frederator are 
  Frederator Studios, an animation production studio in Burbank, and Frederator Digital, which operates

      <p>I served as office manager, client service manager, and social media manager at Park East Animal Hospital, a high-end veterinary practice on the Upper East Side in New York City.</p>
      <p>I was often tasked with learning new practice technologies 
   in order to train the rest of the staff. I wrote numerous technical and process documents over the course 
   of my tenure there from 2007-2015.</p>
      <p>As the social media manager I set up the current version of the <a href="https://parkeastanimalhospital.com">
   Park East website</a>, which is largely unchanged since I left. Much of the copy on the site was written or 
   edited by me, like <a href="http://www.parkeastanimalhospital.com/travel-paperwork.html">this page about 
   international travel paperwork</a>. I also wrote seasonal blog posts about pet health and safety to be published on the site. And I wrote posts for the Park East Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts, which I created.</p>

<!-- SPEC/UX WRITING -->

    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-spec" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-spec-tab">
      <p>I'm particularly interested in UX writing, also known as micricopy writing. I love the unique challenge of crafting informative and engaging copy in limited space. In order to improve my skills I've signed up with <a href="https://dailyuxwriting.com">Daily UX Writing</a>. The following are an assortment of prompts and my solutions to them.</p>
      <div class="row">

<!-- COLUMN 1-->

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p><img src="ux-writing-challenge-1.png" alt="
          Scenario: A traveler is in an airport waiting for the last leg of a flight home when their flight gets abruptly canceled due to bad weather.
          Challenge: Write a message from the airline app notifying them of the cancellation and what they need to do next.
          Headline: 45 characters
          Body: 175 characters max
          Button(s): 25 characters max
          SOLUTION:
          Headline: Dangerous Weather: Flight canceled
          Body: Your safety is our priority. Weâ€™ll get you on the next available flight after the danger has passed. Speak to an agent at the gate, on the phone, or use the app to reschedule.
          Buttons: CALL RESCHEDULE">
          My goal here was to alleviate the user's stress by giving clear instructions for how to proceed, and an explanation of the reason for the cancelation. Emphasizing the airline's commitment to safety gives the user something to feel good about despite the inconvenience.</p>
          <p><img src="ux-writing-challenge-2.png" alt="Scenario: A user is a working parent, and a big sports fan, in the midst of their favorite sports season who can no longer attend games.
          Challenge: Write a promotional screen for an app that lets a user choose teams, sends game reminders, real-time score updates and highlight videos.
          Headline: 40 characters max
          Body: 175 characters max
          Button(s): 25 characters max
          SOLUTION:
          Headline: You'll never miss another game.
          Body: Because life doesn't always give you time for the sports you love, we're here with an assist. Sign up now for real-time scores and highlights from your favorite teams.
          Button: Get The Ball Rolling">
          Convincing a user to sign up for a service or download an app is where UX meets marketing. I focused on words like "you" and "free" to grab the user's attention.
          </p>
          <p><img src="ux-writing-challenge-4.png" alt="Scenario: A user is in their favorite supermarket. They open the supermarketâ€™s app on their phone to see whatâ€™s on sale and are greeted by a promotion.
          Challenge: Write a promotional home screen for a subscription service that delivers groceries to the user once-a-month for a flat fee.
          Headline: 45 characters max
          Body: 175 characters max
          Button(s): 25 characters max 
          SULUTION:
          Headline: Save time, skip the lines.
          Body: Get the same great deals and fresh produce without the hassle. Treat yourself to unlimited deliveries for one low monthly fee.
          Buttons: Learn More, Maybe Later">
        A user accessing the app in the store is obviously willing to make the trip, so this is really a luxury service. I acknowledge that with the phrase "treat yourself" but also let the user know it won't break the bank. It's a luxury, but it's worth it.</p>
        <p><img src="ux-writing-challenge-6.png" alt="Scenario: Itâ€™s Monday. A user has just gotten into their car to drive to work. They plug their phone into the car and start driving.
        Challenge: How would you let the user know thereâ€™s a fire happening in a nearby town that is causing road closures? The effect on their commute is unknown, but there is a definite danger if the fire gets closer. How do you communicate this to them? When? Write it.
 
        Headline: 30 characters max
        Body: 45 characters max
        SOLUTION:
        headline: Fire near I-95 exit 1A
        body: Avoid hazard and delays, use alternate route.">
        Words like 'fire' and 'hazard' will alert the user to danger, while 'delays' will make them think about inconvenience. I decided to tackle this challenge from both angles since sometimes people ignore warnings when they think other options will be more difficult or time consuming.</p>
        <p><img src="ux-writing-challenge-8.png" alt="Scenario: The user is a casual music fan and (on occasion) goes to live concerts. They have a music player app on their phone.  
        Challenge: Tell the user that one of their favorite bands is playing live in their town. How would you compel them to want to go?
        Headline: 30 characters max
        Body: 45 characters max
        Button: 25 characters
        SOLUTION:
        headline: Don't miss Lizzo live
        body: Radio City Music hall 
        Sun, Sep 22
        8PM
        Buttons: Get Tickets  More Shows">
        "Don't miss" will engage the user by appealing to their fear of missing out.</p>
        </div>

<!-- COLUMN 2-->
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p><img src="ux-writing-challenge-bonus.png" alt="
          Scenario: A user needs a ride to the airport. They use their favorite ride-sharing app to schedule the ride. The driver who accepts is hard of hearing.
          Challenge: Write a lockscreen notification that tells the user that their driver is hard of hearing. Include all relevant information (including links) in the notification.
          110 characters max
          SOLUTION: Your driver is hard of hearing. Speak clearly, or communicate by text. More ride details>">
          Notifying the user ahead of time saves both the rider and driver from an awkward encounter. My copy alerts them and educates them on the best way to communicate.</p>
          <p><img src="ux-writing-challenge-3.png" alt="Scenario: The user entered the wrong email address to sign in to their account.
          Challenge: Tell the user to enter the right email.
          40 characters max
          Solution:
          Email not recognized. Please try again.">
          This challenge is deceptively difficult. Writing an error message that does not sound accusatory is hard enough. With only 40 characters to work with there's not a lot of room to be polite or original. I went with a direct approach.</p>
          <p><img src="ux-writing-challenge-5.png" alt="Scenario: The user works in graphic design. While critiquing a design in a mobile app, their phone abruptly turns off. When they restart the phone, they reopen the app.
          Challenge: Write a message that the user will read immediately upon opening the app. What do they need to know? What steps (if any) do they need to take to recover their content? What if they can't recover the content? 
          Headline: 40 characters max
          Body: 140 characters max
          Button(s): 20 characters max
          SOLUTION:
          Headline: Unexpected Shutdown
          Body: Sorry for the interruption. Would you like to pick up where you left off, or start a new project?
          Buttons: Restore, New Project">
          One of the worst feelings for a user is the fear of loss after a crash. It's important to acknowledge and apologize for the app error, and very quickly let them know what happened to their data.</p>
          <p><img src="ux-writing-challenge-7.png" alt="Scenario: A sports fan is at a wedding while their favorite team is playing against their arch-rivals. Their team scores.
          Challenge: How would you, quickly, let the sports fan know about the latest play, the current score, and the key players? Write it.
          Headline: 30 characters max 
          Body: 45 characters max
          SOLUTION:
          headline: USWNT Leads France 2-0
          body: Lloyd sends half-volley past Bouhaddi.">
          This one took a little bit of research since I'm not much of a sports fan.</p>
          <p><img src="ux-writing-challenge-9.png" alt="
          UX Writing Challenge: Day 9
          Scenario: The user is trying to rent a car using an application but the credit card on file has expired.
          Challenge: Write them an error message so that they can correct the problem.
          Headline: 30 characters
          Body: 45 characters
          SOLUTION:
          headline: The card on file has expired.
          body: Please update your credit card to continue.">
          It's important to be compassionate and concise when presenting this kind of information. My copy is direct, but avoids shaming the user.</p>
