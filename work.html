  <h2>What I can do</h2>
  <p class="intro">I have experience with retail, e-commerce, customer service, human resources, operations, and administrative 
  support across a variety of industries. I’m never happy with just one project on my plate, and I love to learn new 
  things. With a keen editorial eye I am passionate about helping creators realize the best version of their own 
  projects. See below for my work history and writing samples.</p>

        <p>Frederator Networks is a digital media company based in New York City. The major divisions of Frederator are 
  Frederator Studios, an animation production studio in Burbank, and Frederator Digital, which operates 
  and programs several YouTube channels and an SVOD channel on the VRV platform. Frederator Digital also runs the 
  Channel Frederator Network, the largest network for animators, artists, and gamers on YouTube.</p>
        <p>Some of the things I do at Frederator:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regularly write internal communications on a variety of topics from memos about HR policy and updates to the employee handbook to welcome guides for new employees and process docs for intern tasks.</li>
        <li>Write <a href="https://frederator.com/jobs">job listings</a> with inclusive language to encourage a diverse applicant pool and support employer brand. I also promote job openings with posts like this one on Linkedin. <img class="center-image" src="linkedinpost.png"></li>
        <li>Wrote and edited copy for <a href="https://frederator.com">frederator.com</a> <a href="https://frederatorstudios.com">frederatorstudios.com</a> and <a href="https:cartoonhangover.com">cartoonhangover.com</a>.

      <a href="https://frederator.com/about"><img class="center-image" src="frederator.png"></a>

      <p>I served as office manager, client service manager, and social media manager at Park East Animal Hospital, a high-end veterinary practice on the Upper East Side in New York City.</p>
      <p>I was often tasked with learning new practice technologies 
   in order to train the rest of the staff. I wrote numerous technical and process documents over the course 
   of my tenure there from 2007-2015.</p>
      <p>As the social media manager I set up the current version of the <a href="https://parkeastanimalhospital.com">
   Park East website</a>, which is largely unchanged since I left. Much of the copy on the site was written or 
   edited by me, like <a href="http://www.parkeastanimalhospital.com/travel-paperwork.html">this page about 
   international travel paperwork</a>. I also wrote seasonal blog posts about pet health and safety to be published on the site. And I wrote posts for the Park East Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts, which I created.</p>

<!-- SPEC/UX WRITING -->

    <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="nav-spec" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-spec-tab">
      <p>I love the unique challenge of crafting informative, engaging copy with compassion and empathy in limited space. In order to improve my skills I've signed up with <a href="https://dailyuxwriting.com">Daily UX Writing</a>. The following are an assortment of prompts and my solutions to them.</p>
        <p>
        <img src="ux-writing-challenge-15.png" alt="An alternate version of Facebook's Page creation process in 4 screens.">
        This is my version of the Facebook Page creation process. The biggest change is that I eliminated all of the optional steps that they currently include. Facebook makes it so easy to add those elements afterwards that it seems unneccessary to include it here. I also changed the language of the final step from 'visit your Page' to 'Finish Page'. Facebook's current version is ambiguous and a user might think they will still have an opportunity to go back and make changes.
