	<h2>What I can do</h2><br>
	I have experience with retail, e-commerce, customer service, human resources, operations, and administrative 
	support across a variety of industries. I’ve worked at a toy store, a bar, a chocolate factory, an animal hospital, 
	and an animation production studio. I’m never happy with just one project on my plate, and I love to learn new 
	things. I have a keen editorial eye and am passionate about helping creators realize the best version of their own 
	projects. See below for my work history and writing samples.<br><br>

          <br>Frederator Books is a digital children's book publisher where I perform developmental, structural, copy, and line editing. At least six books that I edited are due to be released by the end of Q3 2019. <br>
          <br>With thoughtful editing suggestions I helped one author turn his book idea into a series of three. We worked together to bring consistency to the meter and rhyme scheme, and I corrected grammatical and typographical errors.<br>
          <br>I have also written and edited copy for the website.

    <br>StashRiot is the e-commerce subsidiary of Frederator Networks. Originally founded to be a one stop hub for limited edition merchandise from a variety of fandoms, it has since become the shop exclusively for merchandise from the world of Frederator. Top brands include Adventure Time, Bravest Warriors, and Bee and PuppyCat. I am currently the only employee of StashRiot, which means I do everything from product design to copywriting and marketing to charge capture and customer service.

        Here's the product page for a T-shirt I designed. I chose the slogan, which is a quote from the show Bravest Warriors, and wrote the product description.
        <br><br>I launched the shirt in Q3 2019 with an e-blast and social media campaign.<br>

        <strong>Gas Powered Pin Set</strong></div>
        <img class="myImg" src="pinsetshop.png">
        This pin set was designed by an intern under my direction in late 2018 and became a top seller soon after launching in Q1 2019. I'm really pleased with how they turned out and am proud of how well they've been received by fans.
        <br><br>
        I kicked off the social campaign with a few posts to drum up anticipation before the official announcement.

        <img class="myImg" src="hype2.png">
        <br>Since these pins are one of our few in-stock items (as opposed to print on demand) and we only made a limited run, I've been especially focused on conveying urgency in our social media campaigns. I'm anticipating that we will sell out by the end of 2019.

        Take a look at some of my other social media posts. Sometimes I'm funny. Sometimes I get to play with Photoshop.<br>

        Every store has those people who feel the need to lecture about business models and complain about pricing structures. StashRiot has a fan who had regularly been posting disparaging comments. Initially we had ignored him, but enough was enough. I engaged in some light snarkiness and eventually got him to laugh. He hasn't posted any negative comments since.

      Frederator Networks is a digital media company based in New York City. The major divisions of Frederator are Frederator Studios, which is an animation production studio in Burbank, and Frederator Digital, which operates and programs several YouTube channels and an SVOD channel on the VRV platform. Frederator Digital also runs the Channel Frederator Network, the largest network for animators, artists, and gamers on YouTube.<br><br>
      Some of the things I do at Frederator:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Researched and wrote scripts for ToonNerds, a live show which ran on Channel Frederator on YouTube for several weeks in 2015.</li>
        <li>Wrote process documentation and instruction guides for internal use. These are mostly used by interns, but I've written several for new employees and for management.</li>
        <li>Regularly write intra-office memos in my role as Office and Facilities manager, and as HR manager.</li>
        <li>Write job listings with inclusive language to encourage a diverse applicant pool and support employer brand.</li>
        <li>Wrote and edited copy for <a href="https://frederator.com">frederator.com</a> <a href="https://frederatorstudios.com">frederatorstudios.com</a> and <a href="https:cartoonhangover.com">cartoonhangover.com</a>. I also served as project manager for the launch of those three sites in 2018.</li>
      </ul>

      <a href="https://frederator.com/about"><img src="frederator.png"></a></div>
      This is a screencap of the About page on the Frederator Networks website. In it's original version it was a bullet list and the text was very repetitive. I edited it into a paragraph format and incorporated some of Frederator's brand promises. The gif was my idea too.<br><br>

    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-peah" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-peah-tab"><br>
      Park East Animal Hospital is a high-end veterinary practice on the Upper East Side in New York City. They are one of only 12-15% of veterinary practices to acheive AAHA accreditation.<br>
      <br>Since I happen to be a tech savvy individual, I was often tasked with learning new practice tecnhologies in order to train the rest of the staff. I wrote numerous technical and process documents over the course of my tenure there from 2007-2015.<br>
      <br>As the social media manager I set up the current version of the <a href="https://parkeastanimalhospital.com">Park East website</a>, which is largely unchanged since I left. Much of the copy on the site was written or edited by me, like <a href="http://www.parkeastanimalhospital.com/travel-paperwork.html">this page about international travel paperwork</a>. I also wrote seasonal blog posts about pet health and safety which were published on the site. And I wrote posts for the Park East Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts, which I created.<br><br><br>
