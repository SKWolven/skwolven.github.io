  <p class="intro">I have experience with retail, e-commerce, customer service, human resources, operations, and administrative 
  support across a variety of industries. I’m never happy with just one project on my plate, and I love to learn new 
  things. With a keen editorial eye I am passionate about helping creators realize the best version of their own

            <p>I perform developmental, structural, copy, and line editing at Frederator Books, a digital children's book publisher with many new titles coming in 2019.</p>
            <p>With thoughtful editing suggestions I help authors polish their work - from correcting grammar and smoothing out meter and rhymes to building a single book into a series.
            </p>
            <p>I wrote copy for the website to promote the brand and drive users to Epic!, a children's e-book subscription service.</p>
            <p>Visit <a href="https://frederatorbooks.com">Frederator Books</a>.</p>

     <p>Frederator Networks is a digital media company based in New York City. The major divisions of Frederator are 
  Frederator Studios, an animation production studio in Burbank, and Frederator Digital, which operates 
  and programs several YouTube channels and an SVOD channel on the VRV platform. Frederator Digital also runs the 
  Channel Frederator Network, the largest network for animators, artists, and gamers on YouTube.</p>
        <p>Some of the things I do at Frederator:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regularly write internal communications on a variety of topics from memos about HR policy and updates to the employee handbook to welcome guides for new employees and process docs for intern tasks.</li>
        <li>Write <a href="https://frederator.com/jobs">job listings</a> with inclusive language to encourage a diverse applicant pool and support employer brand. I also promote job openings with posts like this one on Linkedin. <img class="center-image" src="images/marketing/linkedinpost.png"></li>
        <li>Wrote and edited copy for <a href="https://frederator.com">frederator.com</a> <a href="https://frederatorstudios.com">frederatorstudios.com</a> and <a href="https:cartoonhangover.com">cartoonhangover.com</a>. I also served as project manager for the launch of those three sites in 2018.</li>
      
      <a href="https://frederator.com/about"><img class="center-image" src="images/marketing/frederator.png"></a>
        <li>Researched and wrote scripts for ToonNerds, a live show which ran on Channel Frederator on YouTube for several weeks in 2015.</li>
</ul>
<img class="divider" src="images/dividers/divider2.png">
 <p>I served as office manager, client service manager, and social media manager at Park East Animal Hospital, a high-end veterinary practice on the Upper East Side in New York City.</p>
      <p>I was often tasked with learning new practice technologies 
   in order to train the rest of the staff. I wrote numerous technical and process documents over the course 
   of my tenure there from 2007-2015.</p>
      <p>As the social media manager I set up the current version of the <a href="https://parkeastanimalhospital.com">
   Park East website</a>, which is largely unchanged since I left. Much of the copy on the site was written or 
   edited by me, like <a href="http://www.parkeastanimalhospital.com/travel-paperwork.html">this page about 
   international travel paperwork</a>. I also wrote seasonal blog posts about pet health and safety to be published on the site. And I wrote posts for the Park East Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts, which I created.</p>

        This pin set was designed by an intern under my direction in late 2018 and became a top seller soon after 
        launching in Q1 2019. I'm really pleased with how they turned out and am proud of how well they've been received 
        by fans.</p>
        <p>I kicked off the social campaign with a few posts to drum up anticipation before the official announcement.

<!--site prototype-->
    <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="nav-ux" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-ux-tab">
      <p>I designed and created a prototype for this site in Adobe XD. Something I think is really interesting about UX design is that it is an iterative process and you end up tweaking things a lot as you go. You can see that the final product is a bit different from how I had originally planned things mostly because of my novice level development skills. It's a good illustration of why it's so important to work cross-functionally with the development team and various stakeholders so that everyone is on the same page about what is feasible.

        <p>I love the unique challenge of crafting informative, engaging copy with compassion and empathy in limited space.
        In order to improve my skills I signed up with <a href="https://dailyuxwriting.com">Daily UX Writing</a>. They sent me a daily challenge for 15 days and you can see my results below.</p><br>

        </div>
              <p>This is my version of the Facebook Page creation process. The biggest change is that I eliminated all of the optional steps that they currently include. Facebook makes it so easy to add those elements afterwards that it seems unneccessary to include it here. I also changed the language of the final step from 'visit your Page' to 'Finish Page'. Facebook's current version is ambiguous and a user might think they will still have an opportunity to go back or cancel.
