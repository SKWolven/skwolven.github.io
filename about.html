	<h2>All about me</h2><br>
	I am fascinated with the written word.  I learned to read in the 1st grade and I couldn’t get enough. A whole universe of stories opened before me from Lloyd Alexander’s fantastical Prydain Chronicles to the wonderfully obtuse adults of Roald Dahl. Growing up into the digital age I’ve seen stories evolve and the English language turned on its head over and over again. Who could have predicted we’d be using the word literally to mean figuratively and that our vocabulary would expand to include pictograms? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
  <br>But that’s the beauty of language. It’s always evolving and unexpected trends are the norm. Especially now, because internet.<br><br><br>

    <br><br>I believe that good writing begins with empathy. The ability to understand the feelings and motivations of the audience Is the only way to consistently deliver engaging copy.
    <br><br>It continues with empathy. The ability to understand the personality and goals of your business or product is the best way to internalize the brand voice and convey the right message every time.
    <br><br>And it ends with (you guessed it!) empathy. An awareness of language and how people use it, how it makes them feel, how it evolves naturally, is essential. Words do not exist in a vacuum. A good writer needs to understand context to put all of these elements together to bring the right message to the right people.<br><br>

    <br><br>When we were 8, my best friend and I invented a secret language. OK, it was just English with a weird alphabet. We were 8! I learned that language can make you feel special, but if used irresponsibly it can make some people feel excluded and alienated.
    <br><br>In high school I learned Esperanto for fun with a tutor I met online. It took all of 10 days and suddenly I was communicating with someone on the other side of the globe. I learned the beauty of simplicity. Esperanto lacks, among other things, the liquidity of a widely used language. It will never develop idioms. But, for the roughly 1 million speakers worldwide, its simplicity opens a door to understanding. I also took French.
    <br><br>At Oberlin College I had planned to go into computer science, but a class called Myth and Hero in the Greek Epic during my first semester changed my mind. I got totally sucked into the Classics department and found myself reading not only classical literature in translation, but epics, speeches, and poetry in their original Latin and Greek. I learned that grammar is important, but not the way I had previously thought. And I learned that careful examination of language can reveal multitudes about the audience and culture for whom it was intended.
    <br><br>I’ve continued my education post-graduation to bolster my skills with classes in copywriting, business and technical writing, SEO writing, and web development – I built this website from scratch, no pre-fab templates for me!
