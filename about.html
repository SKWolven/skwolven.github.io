  <h2>What I can do</h2>
  <p class="intro">I have experience with retail, e-commerce, customer service, human resources, operations, and administrative 
  support across a variety of industries. I’m never happy with just one project on my plate, and I love to learn new 
  things. With a keen editorial eye I am passionate about helping creators realize the best version of their own 
  projects. See below for my work history and writing samples.</p>

        This pin set was designed by an intern under my direction in late 2018 and became a top seller soon after

        by fans.</p>
        <p>I kicked off the social campaign with a few posts to drum up anticipation before the official announcement.

        <p>Frederator Networks is a digital media company based in New York City. The major divisions of Frederator are 
  Frederator Studios, an animation production studio in Burbank, and Frederator Digital, which operates 
  and programs several YouTube channels and an SVOD channel on the VRV platform. Frederator Digital also runs the 
  Channel Frederator Network, the largest network for animators, artists, and gamers on YouTube.</p>
        <p>Some of the things I do at Frederator:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regularly write internal communications on a variety of topics from memos about HR policy and updates to the employee handbook to welcome guides for new employees and process docs for intern tasks.</li>
        <li>Write <a href="https://frederator.com/jobs">job listings</a> with inclusive language to encourage a diverse applicant pool and support employer brand. I also promote job openings with posts like this one on Linkedin. <img class="center-image" src="linkedinpost.png"></li>
        <li>Wrote and edited copy for <a href="https://frederator.com">frederator.com</a> <a href="https://frederatorstudios.com">frederatorstudios.com</a> and <a href="https:cartoonhangover.com">cartoonhangover.com</a>. I also served as project manager for the launch of those three sites in 2018.</li>
      
      <a href="https://frederator.com/about"><img class="center-image" src="frederator.png"></a>
        <li>Researched and wrote scripts for ToonNerds, a live show which ran on Channel Frederator on YouTube for several weeks in 2015.</li>

      <p>I served as office manager, client service manager, and social media manager at Park East Animal Hospital, a high-end veterinary practice on the Upper East Side in New York City.</p>
      <p>I was often tasked with learning new practice technologies 
   in order to train the rest of the staff. I wrote numerous technical and process documents over the course 
   of my tenure there from 2007-2015.</p>
      <p>As the social media manager I set up the current version of the <a href="https://parkeastanimalhospital.com">
   Park East website</a>, which is largely unchanged since I left. Much of the copy on the site was written or 
   edited by me, like <a href="http://www.parkeastanimalhospital.com/travel-paperwork.html">this page about 
   international travel paperwork</a>. I also wrote seasonal blog posts about pet health and safety to be published on the site. And I wrote posts for the Park East Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts, which I created.</p>

      <p>I'm particularly interested in UX writing, also known as micricopy writing. I love the unique challenge of crafting informative and engaging copy in limited space. In order to improve my skills I've signed up with <a href="https://dailyuxwriting.com">Daily UX Writing</a>. The following are an assortment of prompts and my solutions to them.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p><img src="ux-writing-challenge-1.png" alt="
Scenario: A traveler is in an airport waiting for the last leg of a flight home when their flight gets abruptly canceled due to bad weather.
Challenge: Write a message from the airline app notifying them of the cancellation and what they need to do next.
Headline: 45 characters
Body: 175 characters max
Button(s): 25 characters max
SOLUTION:
Headline: Dangerous Weather: Flight canceled
Body: Safety is our top priority. Once the danger has passed we’ll get you on the next available flight. Speak to an agent at the gate, on the phone, or use the app to reschedule.
Buttons: CALL RESCHEDULE">
          My goal here was to alleviate the user's stress by giving clear instructions for how to proceed, and an explanation of the reason for the cancelation. Emphasizing the airline's commitment to safety gives the user something to feel good about despite the inconvenience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p><img src="ux-writing-challenge-bonus.png" alt="
Scenario: A user needs a ride to the airport. They use their favorite ride-sharing app to schedule the ride. The driver who accepts is hard of hearing.
Challenge: Write a lockscreen notification that tells the user that their driver is hard of hearing. Include all relevant information (including links) in the notification.
110 characters max
SOLUTION: Your driver is hearing impaired, but fully able to get you to your destination safely. More ride details>">
            Notifying the user ahead of time saves both the rider and driver from an awkward encounter. My copy addresses any safety concerns they may have, and offers a link to further information about the ride.</p>
