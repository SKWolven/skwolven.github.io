  <h2>DAILY UX WRITING CHALLENGE</h2>
  <br>
        <p>I love the unique challenge of crafting informative, engaging copy with compassion and empathy in limited space.
        In order to improve my skills I completed the <a href="https://dailyuxwriting.com" target="_blank">Daily UX Writing Challenge</a>.</p><br>

          <p><b>The challenge:</b><br>
          Write a notification from a music player app letting the user know that one of their favorite bands is in town.</p>
          <p><b>The solution:</b><br>
          I appealed to the user's FOMO with an attention-grabbing heading, and provided the most relevant information below. The user can opt to buy tickets to the show, see other shows on the tour, or simply close the notification.</p>

          Write a notification from an airline app that the user's flight has been canceled due to bad weather.</p> 
          <p><b>The solution:</b><br> I focused on danger as the reason for the cancelation so that the user, who will feel inconvenienced at this point no matter what, can understand the situation.
          </p> <p>This may seem like a negative approach, but in NYC when the MTA began making truthful service announcements, especially unpleasant ones, riders were much more understanding when faced with delays.</p>

          Write a promotional screen targeted to a busy parent for an app that lets a user choose teams, sends game reminders, real-time score updates, and highlight videos.</p>
          <p><b>The solution:</b><br> 
          I highlighted the benefit - making sports accessible anywhere, anytime, on any device - without focusing on the specific problem of being a 'busy parent.' Any sports fan can benefit from the app and it doesn't make sense to limit the target so much on a landing page.

          <p><b>The solution:</b><br> 
          Whenever someone starts watching a game already in progress, their first question is, "what's the score?" I've given score updates up front in the heading of each notification with more details in the body.</p>

          <p><b>The challenge:</b><br>
          Write an alert for a route monitoring app for truck drivers letting the user know that unexpected delays will either cause them to run late with deliveries, or potentially run low on fuel and miss lunch.</p>
          <p><b>The solution:</b><br> 
          It's not ideal to have a lot of text for someone to read while they should be focused on driving, so I kept this very short. I communicated fuel level and remaining deliveries through icons so the driver can make a decision quickly.

          Write promotional home screen for a subscription service that delivers groceries to the user for a once-a-month flat fee.</p>
          <p><b>The solution:</b><br> 
          I've provided solutions for the main pain points of shopping in-store - traveling to the store,  waiting to check out, and getting the groceries home. For the buttons I added 'maybe later' so that the user knows they can add this service any time even if they decide to ignore it for now.</p>

          Write a driving app alert to notify the user there's a fire happening near their location.</p>
          <p><b>The solution:</b><br> 
          I modeled this after the Google Maps app, so I copied Google's style of simple and direct language. I've alerted the driver to the effects of the fire - road closures and delays - and have given a quick, but detailed description of the location of the problem. The suggested action "reroute" is given in a primary CTA, but the user can choose to ignore it and continue on their original route.

          <p><b>The challenge:</b><br>
          Write a notification from a ride-sharing app that the driver is hard of hearing.</p>
          <p><b>The solution:</b><br> 
          There's not a lot of room in a push notification so I kept this short and direct. I still wanted it to sound friendly though so I included the driver's name to make it feel more personal. I also opted to inform the user of the best way to communicate rather than command them to speak clearly.</p>

          <p><b>The challenge:</b><br>
          Write an error message for when the user enters the wrong email address to sign in to their account.</p>
          <p><b>The solution:</b><br> 
          I wanted to avoid placing blame on the user so I put the responsibility on the app and softened the message by using passive voice - the implication is "we can't find your email" rather than "you wrote the wrong thing, you dummy." I've also offered alternatives - sign in with a phone number, get help, or create a new account.</p>

          <p><b>The solution:</b><br> 
          In cases like this it's important to let the user know what happened to their data as quickly as possible. It's equally important not to shame the user for an improper shut-down procedure. I've given the user the option to get right back to work and also provided a solution to prevent any future data loss.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p><b>The challenge:</b><br>
          An app that allows users to search for local deals on cars needs to ask for the user's first name and zip code, but without sounding like they are unecessesarily mining the user's data.</p> 
          <p><b>The solution:</b><br> 
          I would push back on asking for the user's name. The zip code makes sense, but the price of the car should be the same regardless of the user's name.

          Write an error message from a rental car app that the user's credit card has expired.</p>
          <p><b>The solution:</b><br> 
          From my years of customer service I have learned that it's always better to avoid directly addressing the user when their payments have failed. So rather than "your credit card is expired" I went with "this payment method". Financial processes can be sensitive and a user in a vulnerable state will not want to read a message that sounds accusatory.</p>

          <p><b>The solution:</b><br> 
          The biggest change is that I eliminated all of the optional steps that they currently include. Facebook makes it so easy to add those elements afterwards that it seems unneccessary to include it here. I also changed the language of the final step from 'visit your Page' to 'Finish Page'. Facebook's current version is ambiguous and a user might think they will still have an opportunity to go back or cancel.</p><br>

          I went back and forth on where to put the entry field for e-mail address. Ultimately I put it in the final step because I didn't want to overload the user with tasks at any point of the process. Dealers are also more likely to call than email so I wanted to indicate that the user should expect phone calls.</p>
