  <h2>DAILY UX WRITING CHALLENGE</h2>
  <br>
        <p>I love the unique challenge of crafting informative, engaging copy with compassion and empathy in limited space.
        In order to improve my skills I completed the <a href="https://dailyuxwriting.com">Daily UX Writing Challenge</a>.</p><br>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>The challenge: write a notification from a music player app letting the user know that one of their favorite bands is in town.</p>
          <p>I wanted this to be as integrated into the app as possible so that it wouldn't feel intrusive. The notification I've designed doesn't feel like an annoying pop-up ad. It does not block the player controls and is relevant to the song the user is currently playing. I chose to put all the marketing copy in the headline to really grab the user's attention, and both options on the buttons will allow the user to buy tickets, either to the show listed or to another show on this tour.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6 order-sm-1">
          <p>The challenge: write a notification from an airline app that the user's flight has been canceled due to bad weather.</p> 
            <p>My solution was to focus on danger as the reason for the cancelation so that the user, who will feel inconvenienced at this point no matter what, can understand the situation. I also emphasized the airline's comitment to safety, which will give the user something to feel good about in spite of the inconvenience.</p>

          <p>The challenge: write a promotional screen targeted to a busy parent for an app that lets a user choose teams, sends game reminders, real-time score updates, and highlight videos.</p>
          <p>I made sure to include a sports term, but was careful to avoid jargony copy.

          <p>The challenge: write lock-screen notifications from an app to quickly let a sports fan know about the latest play, current score, and key players of a game they are following.</p>
          <p>I chose to put the score in the headline since the most common question you hear from people who are just starting to watch a game is "what's the score?"</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>The challenge: write an alert for a route monitoring app for truck drivers letting the user know that unexpected delays will either cause them to run late with deliveries, or potentially run low on fuel and miss lunch.</p>
          <p>It's not ideal to have a lot of text for someone to read while they should be focused on driving, so I kept this very short. I put the problem entirely in the headline and left only the question of how to user would like to proceed in the body. The button text mirrors the body so the driver can make a decision quickly and get back to focusing on the road.

          <p>The challenge: write promotional home screen for a subscription service that delivers groceries to the user for a once-a-month flat fee.</p>
          <p>This message is intended for a user who is already in the store and is accessing the app to see what's on sale. Since they've already made  trip to the store I framed the service as a luxury with the words 'treat yourself.' For the buttons I added 'maybe later' so that the user knows they can add this service any time even if they decide to ignore it for now.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>The challenge: write a driving app alert to notify the user there's a fire happening near their location.</p>
          <p>When people are running late they sometimes make stupid decisions and might choose to ignore safety warnings. I chose to stress both the danger of the fire and the inconvenience of road closures to encourage the user to avoid the area.

        <div  class="col-md-6 order-sm-1">
           <p>The challenge: write a notification from a ride-sharing app that the driver is hard of hearing.</p>
            <p>I did that, gave instructions for how the user should communicate with their driver, and provided an opportunity for the user to find out more. I had initially thought of a message that reassures the user their ride will still be safe, but it came off a bit ableist so I scrapped that version and went with this instead.</p>

          <p>The challenge: write an error message for when the user enters the wrong email address to sign in to their account.</p>
          <p>I wanted to avoid placing blame on the user so I put the responsibility on the app - the implication is "we can't recognize your email" rather than "you wrote the wrong thing, you dummy."</p>

          <p>The challenge: write a message to the user as they reopen a graphic design app they'd been using when their phone crashed.</p>
          <p>In cases like this it's important to let the user know what happened to their data as quickly as possible. It's equally important not to shame the user for an improper shut-down procedure. I've apologized for the error, and quickly given the user the option to restore from an auto-saved state.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>The challenge: an app that allows users to search for local deals on cars needs to ask for the user's first name and zip code, but without sounding like they are unecessesarily mining the user's data.</p> 
          <p>To be honest, this one stumped me. If I were working on an actual product team I would push back on asking for the user's name. The zip code makes sense, but the price of the car should be the same regardless of the user's name.

        <div class="col-md-6 order-sm-1">
          <p>The challenge: write an error message from a rental car app that the user's credit card has expired.</p>
          <p>From my years of customer service I have learned that it's always better to say "the card on file" rather than "your credit card" when delivering news of this nature. Payment processes can be sensitive and a user in a vulnerable state will not want to read a message that sounds accusatory.</p>

          <p>The challenge: write a title and meta description for a website that sells subscription contact lenses targeted to an elderly user who is looking for an easy way to buy lenses online.</p>
          <p>I made sure to include plenty of keywords and provide all of the benefits of ordering through this service in the body. You can save money, you place your order once and don't have to think about it again afterwards, and it's risk-free.</p>

        </div>
              <p>This is my version of the Facebook Page creation process. The biggest change is that I eliminated all of the optional steps that they currently include. Facebook makes it so easy to add those elements afterwards that it seems unneccessary to include it here. I also changed the language of the final step from 'visit your Page' to 'Finish Page'. Facebook's current version is ambiguous and a user might think they will still have an opportunity to go back or cancel.

The app also enables dealers to call and email the user so they'll visit the dealership to buy a car. I went back and forth on where to put the entry field for e-mail address. Ultimately I put it in the final step because I didn't want to overload the user with tasks at any point of the process. Dealers are also more likely to call than email so I wanted to indicate that the user should expect phone calls.</p>
